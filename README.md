# Causality2023

We want to use the  "BECauSE Corpus 2.0: Annotating Causality and Overlapping Relations",
https://aclanthology.org/W17-0812/ for a small experiment checking whether chatGPT can detect 
(linguistic) causality in sentences or not.

The corpus is in https://github.com/duncanka/BECauSE.

Our new examples (called syllogisms) are in Logical Causality https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pc1E_OVN_5uq7_G4FpRXnr8NWD7wtl6_pRH_HrX6P80/edit#gid=0
